# sofocus
[Stackoverflow focus](https://userstyles.org/styles/172739/stackoverflow-code-focus-stackexchange) css.

Cleans up stackexchange questions to focus on the answers. 

[Install the style](https://userstyles.org/styles/172739/stackoverflow-code-focus-stackexchange) via Stylish ([Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/), [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en))

The idea is to remove anything you don't use 99% of the time. If you want to downvote or want to view comments, it's easy to just disable the style in the Stylish extension.
